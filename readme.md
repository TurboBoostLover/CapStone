This is a program that I wrote in my 8th week of DevMountain from scratch. It shows the usage of axios, javascript, html, css, and how to set up a front end and a back end.
It has 3 MVP's which include a get request to the server for veiwing homes in the server, and two get request. One in which is a contact form which will save the user's info in the server and the other a info about home pricing and info on their home. The hardest part of the whole project was styling and trying to get it look good with all the different view ports that can access it. It was something I enjoyed building and expanding my knowledge on the topics.
